## <p align="center">Hello!</p>

I am Dennys Marcos, a Full Stack Web Developer.

Currently studying but not limited to - Web Development with **React**, **Node**, **Express**, **Spring**,  **MongoDB**, **PostgreSQL**. <br>

I do not limit my studies to Web Development but that **is** my focus.
I do have some background with Game Development, specifically at the server side, that was meant to specifically ramp up my knowledge with networking, though.

All that aside, I am open to new ideas, projects and fun stuff to learn!

If you feel like, my socials are below so you can connect with me.
